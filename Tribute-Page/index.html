            Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro GOIH ComM ( born 5 February
            1985), better known as Ronaldo, is a Portuguese professional
            footballer who plays as a forward. He is the captain of the
            Portuguese national team and he is currently playing at Saudi
            Arabian football club Al Nassr. He is considered to be one of the
            greatest footballers of all time, and, by some, as the greatest
            ever.

            Ronaldo began his senior career with Sporting CP, before signing
            with Manchester United in 2003, winning the FA Cup in his first
            season. He would also go on to win three consecutive Premier League
            titles, the Champions League and the FIFA Club World Cup; at age 23,
            he won his first Ballon d'Or. Ronaldo was the subject of the
            then-most expensive association football transfer when he signed for
            Real Madrid in 2009 in a transfer worth €94 million (£80 million).
            He became a key contributor and formed an attacking trio with Karim
            Benzema and Gareth Bale which was integral to the team winning four
            Champions League wins from 2014 to 2018, including La Décima. During
            this period, he won back-to-back Ballons d'Or in 2013 and 2014, and
            again in 2016 and 2017. One of the world's most marketable and
            famous athletes, Ronaldo was ranked the world's highest-paid athlete
            by Forbes in 2016, 2017, and 2023, and the world's most famous
            athlete by ESPN from 2016 to 2019. Time included him on their list
            of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2014. He is the
            first footballer and the third sportsman to earn US$1 billion in his
            career.
